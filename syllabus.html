                How can data be interpreted and designed to create stories?
                In this course, students will learn how to use data to design visual narratives.
                They will be guided through the process of identifying and exploring topics of personal interest related to data design.
                By collecting, organizing, interpreting, and visualizing data, students will learn how to build and curate their own database and distilled compelling concept and stories from it.
                <br> <br>
               This course covers both self-collected and open-sourced data, including subjective and objective data.
               It also emphasizes the use of various visual presentation tools. Learning how to choose the right materials and mediums is crucial for storytelling.
               Through this course, students will develop skills in data-driven storytelling, using data to tell personal stories, raise awareness or make them valuable assests in any field where data plays a key role in decision making and communication.
               This will enable them to communicate complex information in an engaging way.
